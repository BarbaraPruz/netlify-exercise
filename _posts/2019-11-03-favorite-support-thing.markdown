<blockquote>
What is your favorite thing about providing technical support?
</blockquote>

<p>In my career, I've done just about everything related to software product development.  Technical, especially developer, support has definitely been my favorite.  I think it is because it regurly combines several roles and activities that I really enjoy:<p>
<ul>
<li>
Detective : maybe its because I've seen too many detective shows, but I like a little mystery.  If software isn't behaving correctly, why?  What are the clues?  Can I propose a theory?  Can I confirm the theory?  Can I use it to identify a solution?</li>
<li>
Teaching and Creating Teaching Tools: I like to educate users on how things work and why, and how to use products.  Whether it is a sample app or site or post or video, I enjoy creating content to help demonstrate ideas or product features.</li>
<li>
Live-long Learning: In technical support, it seems you always see customers applying technology in new and interesting ways.  I really enjoy these opportunities to learn new things.
</li>
<li>
Helping Others to Succeed:  I like to see people succeed.  When I spend time making that happen, I feel good about my day.</li>
</ul>

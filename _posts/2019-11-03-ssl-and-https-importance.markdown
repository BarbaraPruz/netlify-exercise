<blockquote>
Why do you think SSL/HTTPS is important?
</blockquote>
<p>As protocols, SSL and HTTPS (or really the S in HTTPS) provide two important features:</p>
<ul>
<li>The protocol allows endpoints to authenticate each other.  This is accomplished through public certificates.</li>
<li>Data privacy.  This is accomplished through payload encryption.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why are these things important?  Some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>
For a browser, it gets to know that it is talking to the expected host (and not some server pretending to be that host).
</li>  
<li>
Because data is encrypted, it is only available to the endpoints (client and server).  As the message gets passed through the Internet, malicious software cannot see the contents.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Finally, the use of HTTPS is important for SEO.  Google (and likely other search engines) give precedence to HTTPS (vs. HTTP) sites.

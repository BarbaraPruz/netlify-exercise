<h2>Favorite Activities</h2>
I only get 5? It is hard to select only 5 activities! I really enjoy seeing successful users. Their success may be the direct result of support activities like debugging or creating a tutorial.  But product improvements also lead to more successful users.  And so I find it rewarding to help development teams better understand product usage. The top 5:
<ul>
<li>Write and maintain documentation for our software and blog posts for our website.</li>
<li>Create video tutorials to help teach users a specific feature or use case</li>
<li>Debug a customer's build using a programming language and framework that you've never seen before</li>
<li>Spot trends across many cases to improve Netlify's product and service</li>
<li>Work with the development team to help design a new feature based on feedback from customers</li>
</ul>
Honorable mention for favorite activities:
<ul>
<li>Work with people to figure out if Netlify's service can solve a particular workflow or integration challenge they have</li>
<li>Suggest and champion improvements to the Support team's workflow to your colleagues in and out of Support</li>
<li>Submit bug reports and potentially bug fixes to closed and open source projects that Netlify maintains on GitHub</li>
<li>Respond to Netlify customers on Twitter</li>
<li>Engage multiple users at once via chat to answer their questions and troubleshoot problems</li>
<li>Set up your own copy of several static site frameworks for debugging</li>
</ul>
<h2>Not So Favorite Activities</h2>
These aren't in the category of "I'd rather have a root canal".  I view these activities as "everyone in the canoe has got to paddle". So though not my favorites, spending some time on these activities just makes me enjoy my favorites even more.
<ul>
<li>Manage a Support team</li>
<li>Find and recruit teammates for the Support team</li>
<li>Work with prospective customers to explain our service and the pricing model</li>
<li>Help manage communications during a service outage</li>
<li>Deliver a talk to many people you don't know at a conference or meetup</li>
</ul>

My experience deploying to Netlify was very positive. Besides this exercise, I also deployed a couple of React apps using the CLI, drag and drop folder, and Git options.  When exploring Netlify, I noticed the forms functionality and gave that a try.

<p>During my deployments, there were a few bumps in the road - build errors, determining code changes to form submissions, etc.  But each time, I found it very easy to locate relevant helpful information. I was impressed by the quality of the Netlify documentation and issue discussions.  In the issue discussions, I really appreciated the transparency and professional tone. Best of all - I didn't have to resort to reading endless stack overflow questions with debatable answers!

There is always room for improvement.  At this time, I have only sampled a small set of Netlify's features.  I imagine if I explored other areas, I might have some more signficant comments.  But in my experiences, everything worked well and there was plenty of information available to help.

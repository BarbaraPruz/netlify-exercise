I'm a full stack developer.  At the moment, I am freelancing and invovled in several interesting projects that include 
- a literacy analytics app that tracks students reading level based on writing samples
- a bio-pharmaceutical lab monitoring app that helps with FDA compliance requirements
- a non-profit web site matching volunteers with immigrants in need of assistance with tasks like getting a drivers license, applying for citizenship or just improving English skills.

Though I enjoy development, what I really like to do is help developers use and understand software products.  I find this work energizing and rewarding. When working as a support engineer, I always look forward to each day.

I live in Honolulu and I have a long history of working remotely including on international teams.   I'm flexible about my work hours - shifting my day a little in either direction is no problem.
